Now it works and works silently. Script downloads Goose from my github [Requires internet connection] page and installs it at %USERPROFILE% so no admin rights snould be necessary. It works on my sandbox tho. 
Prob v.2 will run from flipper without needing to download the file, but not sure it is possible without qFlipper pre-installed.
